<h2>Basic information. </h2>
Hi. My name is Poel, although I have plenty of other ones. Either call me Poel, Quilt, or Qwin.

I love nicknames, call me whatever you please.

I am pronounfluid as stated in my bio, but while writing this I am currently using he/she/xe/flag pronouns.

If you like the MBTI and enneagram type stuff, I am an ISFP/ISFJ, 9w1, 945, sp/so.


<h2>Do not interact if...</h2>

- You fit <a href="https://basicdni.carrd.co/"> basic DNI criteria</a>.
- You like Okegom. Although there is nothing wrong with having an interest, I find most fans of Okegom very toxic, just don't interact.
- You are just an asshole to people.
- You are a Genshitter, Cookie Runnie, or whatever. Doesn't really apply for current friends, I guess.
- You like YBC, HSL, BNP, or any other nasty shit.
- You don't use <a href="https://tonetags.carrd.co/">tone indicators/tonetags</a>.
- You are apart of House.
- You're one of those bunny hat gore motherfuckers. Get away from me.
- You say slurs you CAN'T reclaim.
- You can't handle swearing.
- You believe blackwashing exists.
- You are a fujoshi, shoutacon, lolicon, etc.
- You purposely make people uncomfortable or trigger people.
- You are a proshipper or like incestuous ships.
- You don't support littles.
- You have an eyestrain pony.
- You support any zoophiles or you are one yourself.

<h2>Before you interact...</h2>

- I have severe anxiety and diagnosed GAD.
- Being in groups of people for me is an absolute mess. I will most likely choose the person I'm a closer friend with/feel more comfortable with and whisper them.
- Even if #nobodyasked, I will still use tonetags/tone indicators randomly.
- The way I type changes depending on my mood.
